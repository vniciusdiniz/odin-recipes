            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup olive oil or butter</li>
                <li>⅓ cup water</li>
                <li>⅓ cup milk or soy milk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 cups tapioca flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>⅔ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine olive oil, water, milk, and salt in a large saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in tapioca flour and garlic, stirring until smooth. Set aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir cheese and eggs into tapioca mixture until combined; the dough will be chunky, like cottage cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drop dough by 1/4 cup-size balls onto an ungreased baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>
