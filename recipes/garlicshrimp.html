            <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon caper brine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 4 equal pieces, divided</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
            <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece of butter, and 1/2 of the parsley; cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste; serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley.</li>
